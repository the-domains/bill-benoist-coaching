LEADING THE CHARGE TOWARDS FULFILLING CAREERS

I am a certified professional career coach who helps people find jobs that fuel their passion rather than sapping it. Together, we will address the confidence, self-awareness and limiting beliefs that can become obstacles in career paths. I also work with the functional aspects of career development including resume and LinkedIn reviews, interviewing preparation, salary negotiations, networking, and industry branding.
